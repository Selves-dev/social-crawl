# Hotel-Grouped Search Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a hierarchical search system that groups rooms by their parent hotels, showing hotels as top-level results with their matching rooms as sub-items.

## Architecture

### Search Flow
```
User Query: "queen camden"
    ↓
1. Search Rooms Index (with field collapse by hotel_id)
    ↓
2. Get unique hotel IDs (paginated, top 20)
    ↓
3. Fetch full hotel details (mget by IDs)
    ↓
4. Check if hotels matched query directly
    ↓
5. Merge & return grouped results
```

### Match Types

**Hotel Match (`match_type: "hotel"`)**
- Hotel name, city, or description matched the query
- Shows ALL rooms for that hotel
- Example: Search "Holiday Inn" → Shows Holiday Inn + all rooms

**Room Match (`match_type: "rooms"`)**
- Only specific rooms matched the query
- Shows ONLY matching rooms
- Example: Search "queen bed" → Shows hotels that have queen rooms + only those queen rooms

## API Response Format

```typescript
{
  success: true,
  results: [
    {
      hotel_id: "123",
      hotel_name: "Holiday Inn London - Camden Lock",
      hotel_slug: "holiday-inn-london-camden-lock",
      location_slug: "england-greater-london-london",
      city: "London",
      neighborhood: "Camden Town",
      description: "...",
      star_rating: 4,
      amenities: ["WiFi", "Gym", ...],
      match_type: "hotel" | "rooms",
      total_rooms: 4,
      showing_rooms: 4,
      rooms: [
        {
          id: "r1",
          room_name: "Standard Queen Room",
          room_slug: "standard-queen-room",
          room_type: "Queen",
          description: "...",
          size_sqm_min: 18,
          size_sqm_max: 22,
          amenities: [...],
          tags: [...],
          ideal_for: [...],
          url: "/library/.../sleep/.../..."
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  total_hotels: 25,      // Total matching hotels
  showing_hotels: 20,    // Hotels in this page
  page: 1,
  has_more: true,
  query: "queen camden",
  terms: ["queen", "camden"]
}
```

## Query Parameters

- `q` - Search query (required for search, optional for browse all)
- `typeahead` - Set to "true" for typeahead mode (returns 5 hotels max)
- `page` - Page number (default: 1, shows 20 hotels per page)

## Search Features

### 1. Multi-Field Matching
Searches across:
- Room names, types
- Hotel names
- City, neighborhood
- Descriptions, amenities, tags

### 2. Fuzzy Matching
- Handles typos: "camdem" → "camden"
- Shorter terms (≤3 chars) use fuzziness: 1
- Longer terms use AUTO fuzziness

### 3. Prefix Matching (Typeahead)
- "cam" matches "camden"
- "que" matches "queen"
- Uses `bool_prefix` for as-you-type experience

### 4. Wildcard Matching
- "*knights*" matches "knightsbridge"
- Substring matching for partial words

### 5. Negative Filtering
- Excludes rooms where query matches `not_ideal_for` field
- Example: Search "solo" won't show rooms marked as "not ideal for solo travelers"

### 6. Field Collapsing
- Uses Elasticsearch's `collapse` feature to group rooms by hotel
- Ensures each hotel appears only once
- Returns all matching rooms via `inner_hits`

## Performance Characteristics

### Query Count: 3 queries
1. **Rooms search with collapse** (~50-150ms)
2. **Hotel details mget** (~10-20ms)
3. **Hotel name matches** (~30-50ms)

**Total: ~100-220ms** ✅

### Scale Performance
- **100,000 hotels + 500,000 rooms**: Efficient
- **Top 20 hotels**: ~100 rooms average, max ~400 rooms
- **Pagination**: Standard 20 hotels per page

## Elasticsearch Indices Used

### Hotels Index
- Full hotel metadata
- Used for: Hotel details lookup, hotel name matching

### Rooms Index
- Room details + denormalized hotel fields (hotel_name, hotel_id, etc.)
- Used for: Primary search, field collapsing

## Example Queries

### Search for specific room type
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/search/venues?q=queen+room"
# Returns hotels with queen rooms, showing only queen rooms
```

### Search for hotel name
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/search/venues?q=holiday+inn"
# Returns Holiday Inn hotels, showing ALL rooms
```

### Search by location
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/search/venues?q=camden"
# Returns Camden hotels, showing ALL rooms
```

### Combined search
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/search/venues?q=queen+camden"
# Returns Camden hotels with queen rooms
```

### Typeahead
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/search/venues?q=que&typeahead=true"
# Returns max 5 hotels for dropdown
```

### Pagination
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/search/venues?q=london&page=2"
# Returns hotels 21-40
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned
- [ ] Geo-location filtering (distance from point, bounding box)
- [ ] Price range filtering (when price service is integrated)
- [ ] Vector search for semantic matching
- [ ] Response caching for popular queries
- [ ] Search analytics/tracking

### Considered
- [ ] "Load more rooms" endpoint for hotels with 50+ rooms
- [ ] Faceted search (filters by amenities, star rating, etc.)
- [ ] Sort options (price, rating, distance)
- [ ] Search suggestions/autocomplete
- [ ] Recently viewed hotels

## Technical Notes

### Why Field Collapsing?
- Native Elasticsearch feature
- More efficient than aggregations for this use case
- Cleaner code than manual grouping
- Returns top N items per group automatically

### Why 3 Queries?
- **Query 1 (rooms)**: Get all matching rooms, grouped by hotel
- **Query 2 (hotel details)**: Get full hotel metadata (can't get from rooms index)
- **Query 3 (hotel matches)**: Determine if hotel name matched (to show all rooms)

Could be reduced to 2 if we fully denormalize hotel data into rooms index, but:
- ❌ Increases index size significantly
- ❌ Makes updates harder (need to update all rooms when hotel changes)
- ✅ Current approach keeps data normalized and manageable

## Development

### File Location
`selves-marketing/server/api/search/venues.get.ts`

### Testing
```bash
# Start dev server
cd selves-marketing
npm run dev

# Test search
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/search/venues?q=queen"
```
