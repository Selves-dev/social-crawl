# Typesense AND Search - Typeahead Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-03  
**Status:** ✅ Implemented

## Overview

AND search has been integrated into the library's typeahead search to ensure ALL search terms must match across ANY fields. This narrows results effectively without rigid filtering.

## How It Works

### Key Setting: `drop_tokens_threshold: 0`

This Typesense parameter ensures ALL query tokens must match somewhere in the searchable fields.

### Example: "standard double"

Results include:
- "Standard King" rooms at "Standard Hotel London" ✅ (both "standard" and "double" match across fields)
- "Double" rooms at "Standard Hotel" ✅ 
- "Standard" rooms with "double bed" in amenities ✅

Results exclude:
- Only "standard" rooms (missing "double") ❌
- Only "double" rooms (missing "standard") ❌

## Implementation

**Location:** `selves-marketing/server/api/search/venues.get.ts`

The search API uses:
```typescript
{
  q: searchQuery,
  query_by: 'room_name,room_type,hotel_name,city,...', // All text fields
  drop_tokens_threshold: 0, // Require ALL tokens to match
  prefix: true, // Allow partial word matching
  num_typos: 2  // Handle typos
}
```

## Testing

### Test the Search

1. Start dev server:
   ```bash
   cd selves-marketing
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/library`

3. Test queries:
   - **"standard double"** - Matches rooms at Standard Hotel with "double" somewhere
   - **"deluxe suite"** - Matches "Deluxe Suite" rooms
   - **"london king"** - Matches "King" rooms in London hotels

### API Testing

```bash
# Test AND logic
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/search/venues?q=standard%20double" | jq '.total'

# Test single word
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/search/venues?q=suite" | jq '.total'
```

## Why This Approach?

### ❌ What We Don't Do: Rigid Filtering
```typescript
// DON'T: Parse "standard double" into structured filters
filter_by: "room_type:=Standard && room_type:=Double" // Too restrictive!
```

### ✅ What We Do: Flexible AND Search
```typescript
// DO: Let Typesense match all terms across any fields
q: "standard double",
drop_tokens_threshold: 0 // Require both words match SOMEWHERE
```

This allows:
- "Standard" in hotel name, "Double" in room type
- "Standard Double" as room name
- "Standard" in tier, "Double" in amenities
- Any combination where BOTH words appear

## Files Modified

- ✅ `selves-marketing/server/api/search/venues.get.ts` - Added `drop_tokens_threshold: 0`
- ✅ Removed complex parsing logic
- ✅ Removed filter building

## Benefits

1. **Flexible**: Matches across any field combinations
2. **Simple**: No keyword lists to maintain
3. **Natural**: Works like users expect search to work
4. **Fast**: Native Typesense feature, no custom logic
