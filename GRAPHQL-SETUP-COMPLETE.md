# GraphQL Setup Complete! ‚úÖ

## What Changed

1. **Enabled GraphQL in Payload** (`payload.config.ts`)
2. **Updated API endpoints** to use GraphQL with explicit field selection
3. **Result**: Private fields (`externalIds`, `internalNotes`, etc.) are **never fetched** from the database

---

## How It Works

### Before (REST API) ‚ùå
```
Fetch ALL fields ‚Üí Delete private fields ‚Üí Send response
```
Private data was fetched then deleted.

### Now (GraphQL) ‚úÖ
```
Request ONLY public fields ‚Üí Send response
```
Private data never touched!

---

## GraphQL Query Example

The API now uses this query:

```graphql
query GetHotel($slug: String!) {
  Hotels(where: { slug: { equals: $slug } }, limit: 1) {
    docs {
      id
      slug
      name
      selves_id
      identity
      contact
      location
      # ... only public fields
      # externalIds NOT requested - never fetched!
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Testing

### 1. Restart Payload

```bash
cd selves-payload
npm run dev
```

Payload will generate `generated-schema.graphql` on startup.

### 2. Test GraphQL Playground

Visit: `http://localhost:3333/api/graphql`

Try this query:

```graphql
query {
  Hotels(limit: 1) {
    docs {
      name
      slug
      identity
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Test Your API Endpoints

```bash
# Schema.org JSON-LD
curl http://localhost:3000/api/hotels/YOUR-SLUG/schema | jq

# Public JSON
curl http://localhost:3000/api/hotels/YOUR-SLUG/public | jq

# Check that externalIds is NOT present
curl http://localhost:3000/api/hotels/YOUR-SLUG/public | jq '.externalIds'
# Should return: null
```

### 4. Verify in MongoDB

Check that `externalIds` exists in your database but is not returned by the API:

```bash
# In MongoDB
db.hotels.findOne({ slug: 'YOUR-SLUG' }, { externalIds: 1 })
# Should show externalIds exists

# In API
curl http://localhost:3000/api/hotels/YOUR-SLUG/public
# Should NOT include externalIds
```

## Benefits

1. ‚úÖ **Never fetches private data** - not just filtered, actually not requested
2. ‚úÖ **More efficient** - less data over the wire
3. ‚úÖ **Type-safe** - GraphQL provides types
4. ‚úÖ **Flexible** - easy to add/remove fields
5. ‚úÖ **Standard** - GraphQL is industry standard
6. ‚úÖ **Better performance** - only fetch what you need

## GraphQL Playground Features

Visit `http://localhost:3333/api/graphql` and you can:

- üìñ Browse auto-generated docs
- üîç Explore schema
- üß™ Test queries interactively
- üìù See all available fields

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Restart Payload CMS
- [ ] Test GraphQL playground
- [ ] Test API endpoints
- [ ] Verify externalIds not returned
- [ ] Update your `usePayload` composable to optionally use GraphQL
- [ ] Consider GraphQL codegen for type safety

---

## Optional: GraphQL Codegen

For even better type safety, you can generate TypeScript types from your GraphQL schema:

```bash
npm install -D @graphql-codegen/cli @graphql-codegen/typescript
npx graphql-codegen init
```

This will give you fully typed GraphQL queries in TypeScript!
