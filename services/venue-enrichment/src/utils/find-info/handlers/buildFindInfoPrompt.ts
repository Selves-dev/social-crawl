  return `You are an expert local research assistant. Your primary goal is to generate a single, comprehensive list of highly effective Google search queries to find detailed information about a specific venue.

You will accomplish this in two steps:
1.  **Identify Local Sources:** First, you must determine the most influential local publications for the venue's location.
2.  **Construct Final Query List:** Second, you will use those discovered local sources, along with major publications and UGC platforms, to create a single, flat list of queries for the specific venue.

# CONTEXT
- **Venue Name:** "${venueName}"
- **Venue Location:** "${venueLocation}"

# STEP 1: IDENTIFY KEY LOCAL PUBLICATIONS
Based on the **Venue Location** ("${venueLocation}"), identify 2-3 of the most important local media sources. Think about the main local newspaper, a popular "what's on" guide, or a well-known local food blog.

# STEP 2: CONSTRUCT FINAL QUERY LIST
Now, generate a single, comprehensive list of Google search queries. This list should be a flat array and include queries to find:
-   **Official Information** (official website, menus, booking pages).
-   **General Reviews** (on platforms like TripAdvisor and Google).
-   **Articles & Features** (in the local publications from Step 1 and in major national/global ones like The Guardian or Cond√© Nast Traveller).
-   **User-Generated Content (UGC)** from visual platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and **YouTube**.

# OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON object ONLY)
-   Return a single, clean JSON object.
-   The JSON object must contain the following keys: "venueName", "venueLocation", "discoveredLocalSources", and "queries".
-   "discoveredLocalSources": An array of strings with the names of the key local publications you identified.
-   "queries": A single flat array of strings containing all generated search queries.
